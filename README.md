# Library-System
This is library system was created using Java (Netbeans and MySQL)
There are 2 users;Member and Librarian
Member can only find items in system using itemcode or title.
Librarian can borrow item, return item, find item, add item , find member, add member, generate inventory report, generate financial report, generate transaction log
Borrow and return item does not have date option so fine cannot be calculated
The GUI is created in a very simple UI so that developer can edit easily in their own ways
